#ofxEyetech

ofxEyetech provides a simple Quicklink API wrapper for Eyetech gaze sensor devices. Eyetech sensors use an infrared illuminated PTGrey camera to measure binocular gaze in a calibrated area. Angular saccade behaviour, fixation, binocular coordination and stimuli response can be measured easily with this device. It is also used as an HCI interface, allowing a user to control an operating system or drive input with intentional gaze.

The gaze area is captured interactively through calibrated gazing. Deleting addons/ofxEyetech/calibration/calibration will prompt the calibration window on start up and generate a new file.

The QuickLINK library uses a contained OpenCV2.2 framework and ofxOpenCV is not required to build the example.
